**I built a physically-based global illumination renderer from scratch. No game engine. No shortcuts. Just math and GPU power.** 

The classic Cornell Box — rendered with real light physics, not faked.

## Why radiosity?

In 1984, Cindy Goral at Cornell published the first-ever radiosity paper in computer graphics: "Modeling the interaction of light between diffuse surfaces." It was a heat-transfer method borrowed from thermal engineering — applied to pixels for the first time. **The Cornell Box was literally invented to validate it.**

40 years later, most renderers use path tracing (Monte Carlo sampling of the rendering equation). It's flexible but noisy. Radiosity is the opposite: **brute-force, deterministic, patch-to-patch**. Every surface talks to every other surface. Just the raw double-area integral between every pair of triangles.

It's the OG approach. And it produces that buttery-smooth indirect light that path tracers need thousands of samples to match.

## What makes it real:

- Classical patch-to-patch form factors — the original brute-force method, no shortcuts
- Every surface exchanges light with every other surface — no faking it
- Visibility checking on GPU via OptiX ray tracing
- Light bounces naturally between walls → red/green color bleed
- Soft shadows emerge from the physics, not from blur tricks
- Real material properties from the original Cornell Box spec: https://bowers.cornell.edu/cornell-box

Implemented with C++ / CUDA / OptiX 9.1

No Unity. No Unreal. No Blender. Just the raw equations of light.
